# Basic Banking System

This is a simple console-based banking system implemented in Java. It allows users to deposit money, withdraw money, check their balance, and exit the system. The balance is maintained in memory for the duration of the program.

- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw money from their balance, provided they have sufficient funds.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current balance.
- **Exit the System**: Users can exit the banking system.

## Run the compiled Java program:

## Use the following menu options to interact with the banking system:
1. `Deposit`: Enter an amount to add to your balance.
